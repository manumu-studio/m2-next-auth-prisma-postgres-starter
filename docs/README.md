# Docs

Project documentation & working notes.

## Layout
- `DEVELOPMENT_JOURNAL.md` – high-level log with links to entries
- `journal/ENTRY-*.md` – day-by-day detailed notes
- `screenshots/` – images used in docs/PRs
- `_archive/` – parked code and concepts (not part of build)

## Writing Entries
1. Create `docs/journal/ENTRY-X.md`.
2. Link it from `DEVELOPMENT_JOURNAL.md`.
3. Add screenshots in `docs/screenshots/`.
