# ENTRY-0 — Project Bootstrap

**Date:** October 3, 2025  
**Type:** Initial Setup  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## Overview

This entry documents the initial bootstrap phase of **ManuMu Authentication**, establishing the foundational architecture and development environment for a production-ready authentication system.

---

## What We Built

### Core Technology Stack

- **Next.js 15** with App Router architecture
- **TypeScript** with strict mode enabled
- **Chakra UI** for component library
- **Prisma ORM** with PostgreSQL database
- **NextAuth v4** (Auth.js) for authentication framework

### Project Structure

Established a clean, scalable project structure:

```
src/
├── app/                    # Next.js App Router
│   ├── layout.tsx         # Server root layout
│   └── providers.tsx     # Client providers (SessionProvider, Chakra)
├── features/              # Feature-based architecture
└── lib/                   # Shared utilities
```

### Server/Client Boundary

Implemented clear separation between server and client components:

- **Server Components**: `app/layout.tsx` handles server-side rendering
- **Client Components**: `app/providers.tsx` manages client-side state and providers
- This separation enables optimal performance and prevents hydration mismatches

### Database Setup

- Initialized Prisma schema with NextAuth-compatible models
- Configured PostgreSQL datasource
- Set up migration system for version control
- Created seed script for development data

### Environment Configuration

- Created `.env.example` template for required environment variables
- Configured `.gitignore` to exclude `.env` and `.env.local`
- Established environment variable validation pattern

---

## Files Created

### Configuration Files
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration (strict mode)
- `next.config.ts` - Next.js configuration
- `eslint.config.mjs` - ESLint configuration
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Database schema

### Project Structure
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Root server layout
- `src/app/providers.tsx` - Client providers wrapper
- `prisma/migrations/` - Database migration directory
- `.env.example` - Environment variable template

---

## Rationale

### Why Feature-Based Architecture?

The feature-based structure (`src/features/auth/`) provides:
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new features without cluttering
- **Maintainability**: Related code lives together
- **Team Collaboration**: Clear ownership boundaries
- **Testability**: Isolated features are easier to test

### Why Server/Client Separation?

Explicit server/client boundaries:
- **Performance**: Server components reduce JavaScript bundle size
- **Security**: Sensitive logic stays on server
- **SEO**: Server-rendered content improves search visibility
- **Developer Experience**: Clear mental model of data flow

---

## Impact

This bootstrap phase establishes:
- ✅ Modern, production-ready foundation
- ✅ Type-safe development environment
- ✅ Scalable architecture for future features
- ✅ Best practices from day one

---

## Next Steps

With the foundation in place, the next phase focuses on:
1. User registration flow (signup UI + server action)
2. Authentication implementation (sign-in flow)
3. Session management and persistence

---

**Foundation Complete** ✅  
*The project is now ready for feature development with a solid, scalable architecture.*
